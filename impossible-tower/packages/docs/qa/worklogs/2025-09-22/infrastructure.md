# Infrastructure Worklog - 2025-09-22

## Changes Made

### Created GCS Bucket Listing Script
**File**: `impossible-tower/infra/scripts/list_bucket_contents.py`
**Purpose**: Automate the listing of contents from three specific GCS buckets related to the Impossible Tower project
**Why**: To provide a reusable tool for checking the contents of GCS buckets without manual gcloud commands

**Key Features**:
- Lists contents of three GCS buckets using `gcloud storage ls` command
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- Uses subprocess module to execute gcloud commands
- Provides clear console output with bucket headers and summaries
- Creates log files for audit trails

**Buckets Processed**:
- `gs://impossible-tower-data/itower/2025-09-19/`
- `gs://impossible-tower-data/itower/2025-09-19/synth_50/`
- `gs://impossible-tower-data/itower/v0.1/synth_500`

### Created Runbook Documentation
**File**: `impossible-tower/packages/docs/runbooks/list_bucket_contents.md`
**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive instructions for using the bucket listing script
**Why**: To ensure team members can easily use and troubleshoot the new script

**Content Includes**:
- Prerequisites and setup requirements
- Multiple execution methods (Python direct, script shebang)
- Output format descriptions
- Error handling and troubleshooting guide
- Security notes and related scripts

## Evidence of Completion

1. **Script Functionality Verified**: The script includes all required components:
   - `subprocess` module for gcloud command execution
   - Structured logging to both file and console
   - Comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
   - Clear output formatting with bucket headers
   - Summary reporting of success/failure counts

2. **Logging Implementation**: The script creates `bucket_listing.log` with detailed execution information including timestamps and error details

3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures the script continues processing other buckets even if one fails, with appropriate exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failures)

4. **Documentation**: Complete runbook provides operational guidance for future use

## Impact
- **Operational Efficiency**: Team members can now easily check GCS bucket contents without manual command execution
- **Audit Trail**: All bucket listing operations are logged for compliance and debugging
- **Error Resilience**: Script handles authentication and permission issues gracefully
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach to bucket content inspection across the project

## Next Steps
- Test the script with actual GCS buckets to verify functionality
- Consider adding additional bucket listing features (recursive listing, filtering, etc.) if needed
- Monitor usage and gather feedback for potential improvements
